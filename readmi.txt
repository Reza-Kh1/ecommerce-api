I have developed the backend of an e-commerce site using Node.js and the libraries Express.js & Mongoose.
Within this application, I have implemented authentication and search filters for displaying products.
I worked with a connection to the MongoDB database, and I have provided the API address as a file 
that you can import into the Postman application to use and access the endpoints
